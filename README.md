Real-Time Location Sharing for Socializing at MUST
Introduction
The Real-Time Location Sharing for Socializing at MUST project aims to solve the problem of students at Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) struggling to locate their friends on or around campus. The system will enable students to easily find each other in real-time, reducing the time and effort spent on communication and improving safety during late hours. The solution will use a client-server model for efficient and secure location sharing.

Problem Overview
Students at MUST face difficulty when trying to find friends, especially on large campuses or nearby areas. Meeting up often requires several phone calls or messages, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, safety concerns arise when students move around campus or surrounding areas, particularly at night. The lack of a real-time solution to address these issues leads to missed social and collaborative opportunities.

Proposed Solution
This project will develop a real-time location-sharing application specifically designed for MUST students. The app will allow users to share their current location with selected friends, view their friends’ locations on a map, and communicate through messaging. The app will be built using a client-server architecture:

Server: Manages location data, handles requests, and ensures secure communication.
Clients: Students’ smartphones with an app that updates location in real-time and allows communication with friends.
Features
Location Sharing: Real-time GPS-based location updates.
Privacy Controls: Users can choose who can view their location.
Messaging: In-app communication with friends for easier meetups.
Energy Efficiency: Optimized for minimal battery consumption.
Data Security: Encryption for secure transmission and storage of location data.
Benefits
The system will reduce the complexity of finding friends, making social interactions faster and easier. The app will improve safety on campus by allowing students to track their friends in real-time. Additionally, the client-server model will ensure the app is scalable and provides up-to-date, secure location information.
